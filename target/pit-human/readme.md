# PIT Results – Human-written Tests

This directory contains mutation testing results generated by **PIT** when executing
**manually written (human-authored) unit tests only**.

## Purpose
This suite serves as the **human baseline** for comparison against
automated test generation techniques.

## Contents (generated during CI)
- `index.html` – PIT HTML report
- `mutations.csv` – detailed mutation-level results
- coverage summaries (line, branch, mutation score)

## Notes
- Tests included: manually written JUnit tests
- Automated tests (Randoop, EvoSuite, LLM-generated) are excluded
- Results are produced automatically by GitHub Actions and stored as CI artifacts

## Usage in Paper
Reported as:
> **Human baseline mutation score and coverage**
